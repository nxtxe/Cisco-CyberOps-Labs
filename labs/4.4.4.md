### Part 1: Log File Overview

**Question:** Based on the log entry below, describe what happened.  
```
[Wed Mar 22 11:23:12.207022 2017] [core:error] [pid 3548:tid 4682351596] [client 209.165.200.230] File does not exist: /var/www/apache/htdocs/favicon.ico
```  
**Answer:** At the specified date and time, Apache logged an error indicating that a client with IP 209.165.200.230 requested the file “favicon.ico” but it was not found in the expected directory.

**Question:** Is the output of the sample log file from `/var/log/logstash-tutorial.log` still considered a web transaction? Explain why its format is different from the single entry shown above.  
**Answer:** Yes, it is still a web transaction. The sample log file uses a common log format that combines multiple pieces of information (client IP, timestamp, request method, resource, status code, etc.), while the example in (a) is an error log entry formatted by Apache with additional details such as process IDs and error types.

### Part 2: Operating System Log File Example

**Question:** A user reported that network operations were slow around 2:30 pm on March 20. Can you find evidence of that in the log entries from `/var/log/messages`? If so, in what lines? Explain.  
**Answer:** Yes. The log shows several network interface events (for example, repeated “link down” and “link up” messages for the network adapter) around 14:28–14:29 on March 20, which could explain the reported network slowness.
