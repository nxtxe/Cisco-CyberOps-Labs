### Part 1: Working with Graphical and Command Line Text Editors

**Question (f):** Could you immediately find space.txt?  
**Answer:** No, because SciTE initially shows only known file types. You must change the filter to "All Files" to see space.txt.

**Question (d) in Step 2:** Why is the prompt not shown in the terminal?  
**Answer:** Because SciTE is running in the foreground, which keeps the terminal occupied without showing a new prompt.

**Question (b) in Part 2:** What character does nano use to represent that a line continues beyond the screen boundaries?  
**Answer:** Nano displays a "$" at the end of a long line to indicate it continues off-screen.

### Part 3: Working with Configuration Files

**Question:** Why are user application configuration files saved in the user’s home directory and not under /etc with all the other system-wide configuration files?  
**Answer:** Because user configuration files only affect the individual user and allow personal customization without requiring root privileges, while /etc holds system-wide settings.

**Question (g):** Did the terminal window which was already open also change color from green to red? Explain.  
**Answer:** No; only new terminal sessions load the updated .bashrc file. Existing sessions remain unchanged until they’re restarted or reloaded.

**Question (i) in Step 3:** What is the error message referring to?  
**Answer:** It indicates that nginx encountered an issue—typically that the specified document root or configuration parameter is incorrect or missing.

**Question (k):** Does the web page appear?  
**Answer:** No; after shutting down nginx, the web page no longer appears.

**Challenge Question:** Can you edit the /etc/nginx/custom_configuration.conf file with SciTE? Describe the process below.  
**Answer:** Yes. You open a terminal and run a command like  
`sudo scite /etc/nginx/custom_configuration.conf`  
which launches SciTE with root privileges, allowing you to edit and save the file.
