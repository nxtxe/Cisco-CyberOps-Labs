### **Objectives**

* **Part 1:** Examine a Telnet Session with Wireshark
* **Part 2:** Examine an SSH Session with Wireshark

### **Background / Scenario**

In this lab, you will configure a router to accept SSH connectivity and use Wireshark to capture and view Telnet and SSH sessions. This demonstrates the importance of encryption with SSH.

### **Required Resources**

* CyberOps Workstation virtual machine

## **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Examine a Telnet Session with Wireshark**

#### **Step 1: Capture data**

1. Start the CyberOps Workstation VM.
2. Log in as:

   ```
   Username: analyst
   Password: cyberops
   ```
3. Open a terminal and start Wireshark:

   ```
   [analyst@secOps ~]$ wireshark &
   ```
4. In Wireshark, start a capture on the **Loopback: lo** interface.
5. Open another terminal window and start a Telnet session:

   ```
   [analyst@secOps ~]$ telnet localhost
   ```
6. Enter credentials when prompted:

   ```
   Username: analyst
   Password: cyberops
   ```
7. After successful login and output appears, stop the Wireshark capture.

#### **Step 2: Examine the Telnet session**

1. In Wireshark, apply the display filter:

   ```
   telnet
   ```
2. Right-click a Telnet packet and choose:

   ```
   Follow > TCP Stream
   ```
3. Observe that all session data, including the username and password, is shown **in plaintext**.

   * Duplicate characters appear due to Telnetâ€™s echo behavior.
4. Click **Close** on the TCP Stream window.
5. Exit the Telnet session:

   ```
   [analyst@secOps ~]$ exit
   ```

### **Part 2: Examine an SSH Session with Wireshark**

#### **Step 1: Capture data**

1. Start a new Wireshark capture on the **Loopback: lo** interface.
2. In the terminal, initiate an SSH session:

   ```
   [analyst@secOps ~]$ ssh localhost
   ```
3. Accept the host fingerprint:

   ```
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   ```
4. Enter password:

   ```
   analyst@localhost's password: cyberops
   ```
5. Once logged in, stop the Wireshark capture.

---

#### **Step 2: Examine the SSH session**

1. In Wireshark, apply the display filter:

   ```
   ssh
   ```
2. Right-click a packet and choose:

   ```
   Follow > TCP Stream
   ```
3. Observe that **all data is encrypted** and unreadable, unlike the Telnet session.
4. Click **Close**, then close Wireshark.

## **Reflection Question**

**Q: Why is SSH preferred over Telnet for remote connections?**
**A:** SSH is preferred over Telnet because SSH encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, including login credentials, which prevents attackers from viewing sensitive information. In contrast, Telnet transmits all data in plaintext, making it highly insecure and vulnerable to packet sniffing and credential theft.
