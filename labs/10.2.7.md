### Part 2: Use Wireshark to Capture DNS Queries and Responses

#### Step 2: Examine the Fields in a DNS Query Packet

**Question:** Is the source MAC address the same as the one recorded from Part 1 for the VM?  
**Answer:** Yes; the source MAC address in the DNS query matches the VM’s NIC MAC address.

**Question:** Can you identify the IP and MAC addresses for the source and destinations of this packet?  
**Answer:**  
- **Source (Workstation):**  
  - **IP Address:** For example, 192.168.0.11  
  - **MAC Address:** The same as the VM’s recorded MAC address (e.g., 08:00:27:82:75:df)  
- **Destination (DNS Server):**  
  - **IP Address:** For example, 8.8.8.8  
  - **MAC Address:** The destination MAC is that of the default gateway since the packet is forwarded out of the local LAN.

**Question:** Is the source IP address the same as the local PC’s IP address you recorded in Part 1?  
**Answer:** Yes; the source IP in the DNS query is the same as the local PC’s IP.

**Question:** Is the destination IP address the same as the default gateway noted in Part 1?  
**Answer:** No; the destination IP is the DNS server’s IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8), not the default gateway.

#### Step 3: Examine the Fields in a DNS Response Packet

**Question:** In the Ethernet II frame for the DNS response, what device is the source MAC address and what device is the destination MAC address?  
**Answer:** The source MAC address belongs to the default gateway (which forwards the DNS server’s reply), and the destination MAC address belongs to the local PC’s NIC.

**Question:** What is the destination IP address?  
**Answer:** The destination IP address is the local PC’s IP address (the one that sent the DNS query).

**Question:** What is the source IP address?  
**Answer:** The source IP address is that of the DNS server (for example, 8.8.8.8).

**Question:** What happened to the roles of source and destination for the VM and default gateway?  
**Answer:** In the DNS query, the VM is the source and the DNS server is the destination; in the DNS response, these roles are reversed—the DNS server becomes the source, and the VM becomes the destination. However, because the packet is routed via the default gateway, the MAC addresses still involve the gateway.

### Reflection

**Question:** What are the benefits of using UDP instead of TCP as a transport protocol for DNS?  
**Answer:** UDP has lower overhead, allowing for faster transmission of small queries like DNS requests, which do not require the connection setup and reliability features of TCP.
