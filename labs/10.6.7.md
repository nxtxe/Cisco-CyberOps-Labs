## Part 2: View HTTPS Traffic

**Step 1 (b):**  
**Question:** What has replaced the HTTP section that was in the previous capture file?  
**Answer:**

## Reflection Questions

**Question 1:** What are the advantages of using HTTPS instead of HTTP?  
**Answer:**  
- HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and server, protecting it from eavesdropping.  
- It helps maintain data integrity and authenticates the communicating parties, reducing the risk of tampering.

**Question 2:** Are all websites that use HTTPS considered trustworthy?  
**Answer:**  
- No. HTTPS secures data in transit but does not guarantee that the website itself is safe or reputable.  
- Trustworthiness depends on additional factors, such as the legitimacy of the siteâ€™s certificate and the reputation of the website.
