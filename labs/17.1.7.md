## Part 2: Explore DNS Query Traffic

**Step 2 (d):**
**Question:** What are the source and destination MAC addresses? Which network interfaces are these MAC addresses associated with?
**Answer:**

* The source MAC address belongs to the PC’s network interface.
* The destination MAC address is the router or DNS server’s interface on the same LAN.

**Step 2 (e):**
**Question:** What are the source and destination IP addresses? Which network interfaces are these IP addresses associated with?
**Answer:**

* The source IP is the PC’s local IP address.
* The destination IP is the DNS server’s IP address, often the router or external DNS 8.8.8.8.

**Step 2 (f):**
**Question:** What are the source and destination ports? What is the default DNS port number?
**Answer:**

* Source port: a random high-numbered ephemeral port.
* Destination port: 53 default DNS port.

**Step 2 (g):**
**Question:** Compare the MAC and IP addresses in the Wireshark results to the IP and MAC addresses. What is your observation?
**Answer:**

* The PC’s MAC and IP in Wireshark match those shown in ipconfig/ifconfig.
* Confirms the packet originated from the local machine.

## Part 3: Explore DNS Response Traffic

**Step 3 (a):**
**Question:** What are the source and destination MAC and IP addresses and port numbers? How do they compare to the addresses in the DNS query packets?
**Answer:**

* Source MAC/IP: DNS server reversed from query.
* Destination MAC/IP: PC same as source in query.
* Source port: 53, destination port: same ephemeral port from query.

**Step 3 (c):**
**Question:** Can the DNS server do recursive queries?
**Answer:**

* Yes, indicated by the Recursion Available flag in the response.

**Step 3 (d):**
**Question:** How do the results compare to nslookup results?
**Answer:**

* The A and CNAME records in Wireshark match the IP and alias shown in nslookup.

## Reflection Questions

**Question 1:** From the Wireshark results, what else can you learn about the network when you remove the filter?
**Answer:**

* You can see other protocols ARP, TCP, HTTP, device IPs, MACs, and communication patterns.

**Question 2:** How can an attacker use Wireshark to compromise your network security?
**Answer:**

* By capturing sensitive data like login credentials in unencrypted traffic.
* By mapping devices and identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
