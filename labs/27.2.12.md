**Question: What is the significance of this information?**
**Answer:** It shows that the attacker tried to use SQL injection to access credit card data by modifying a login request to run a SELECT query on the database.

**Question: What do you see later in the transcript as regards usernames?**
**Answer:** Later in the transcript, you can see actual usernames being displayed along with sensitive data, which suggests that the injection worked and private information was exposed.

**Question: Give some examples of a username, password, and signature that was exfiltrated.**

### Part 2: Analyze DNS Exfiltration

**Question: Record the IP addresses of DNS client and server.**
**Answer:** DNS Client IP: 192.168.10.15, DNS Server IP: 192.168.10.53

**Question: Were the subdomains from the DNS queries subdomains? If not, what is the text?**
**Answer:** No, they were not real subdomains. The text was encoded data in hexadecimal format.

**Question: What does this result imply about these particular DNS requests? What is the larger significance?**
**Answer:** It implies that DNS was used to exfiltrate data by hiding information inside fake subdomain names. This shows how attackers can use normal-looking DNS traffic to leak sensitive data.

**Question: What may have created these encoded DNS queries and why was DNS selected as the means to exfiltrate data?**
**Answer:** A script or malware likely generated the DNS queries. DNS was used because it usually isnâ€™t blocked by firewalls and is often ignored in traffic inspection, making it a stealthy method for exfiltration.
