### Part 1: Examine the Header Fields in an Ethernet II Frame

**Question:** What is significant about the contents of the destination address field?  
**Answer:** The destination address in the ARP request is set to broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff), meaning the frame is sent to every device on the LAN.

**Question:** Why does the PC send out a broadcast ARP prior to sending the first ping request?  
**Answer:** The PC must resolve the MAC address of its default gateway (or target host) because it only has the IP address, so it broadcasts an ARP request to all devices.

**Question:** What is the MAC address of the source in the first frame?  
**Answer:** The source MAC address is shown as **f4:8c:50:62:62:6d**.

**Question:** What is the Vendor ID (OUI) of the Source’s NIC?  
**Answer:** The OUI is the first three octets, which are **f4:8c:50**.

**Question:** What portion of the MAC address is the OUI?  
**Answer:** The OUI comprises the first 3 octets (first 6 hexadecimal digits) of the MAC address.

**Question:** What is the Source’s NIC serial number?  
**Answer:** The serial number is contained in the last 3 octets, here **62:62:6d**.

### Part 2: Use Wireshark to Capture and Analyze Ethernet Frames

**Step 5 – Examining the First Echo Request Frame:**

**Question:** What is the MAC address of the PC’s NIC?  
**Answer:** It is the source MAC address shown in the Ethernet II header of the echo request; for example, it matches H3’s NIC (as configured in the Mininet topology).

**Question:** What is the default gateway’s MAC address?  
**Answer:** It is the destination MAC address in the echo request, which corresponds to the router’s (default gateway’s) interface—e.g., **76:93:c1:c2:e9:5c** (as observed from the ARP cache).

**Question:** What type of frame is displayed?  
**Answer:** The frame is an Ethernet II frame.

**Question:** What is the source IP address?  
**Answer:** The source IP address is that of H3’s interface (for example, **10.0.0.13**).

**Question:** What is the destination IP address?  
**Answer:** The destination IP address is that of the default gateway (e.g., **10.0.0.1**).

**Question:** What device and MAC address is displayed as the destination address in the Echo reply?  
**Answer:** In the echo reply, the destination address is H3’s NIC, and its MAC address matches H3’s interface MAC.

**Step 7 – Examining the New Capture for Remote Traffic:**

**Question:** In the first echo (ping) request frame, what are the source and destination MAC addresses?  
**Answer:**  
- **Source:** The MAC address of H3’s NIC (as shown in the frame).  
- **Destination:** The MAC address of the default gateway (the router’s interface).

**Question:** What are the source and destination IP addresses contained in the data field of the frame?  
**Answer:**  
- **Source IP:** H3’s IP address (e.g., **10.0.0.13**).  
- **Destination IP:** The remote host’s IP address (**172.16.0.40**).

**Question:** Why has the destination IP address changed, while the destination MAC address remained the same?  
**Answer:** The packet’s IP header is modified to target the remote destination (172.16.0.40); however, because the packet must still be delivered via the default gateway, the destination MAC remains that of the router’s interface.

### Reflection

**Question:** Wireshark does not display the preamble field of a frame header. What does the preamble contain?  
**Answer:** The preamble contains a series of synchronization bits that help the network interface card (NIC) lock onto the incoming frame.
