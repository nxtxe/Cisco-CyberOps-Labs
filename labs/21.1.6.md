### **Part 1: Hashing a Text File with OpenSSL**

**f. Question:**

> **Is the new hash different than the hash calculated in item (d)? How different?**

**Answer:**
Yes, the new hash is completely different. In item (d), the SHA-256 hash was:

```
deff9c9bbece44866796ff6cf21f2612fbb77aa1b2515a900bafb29be118080b
```

After changing just **one letter** (‘m’ to ‘p’), the new SHA-256 hash became:

```
43302c4500b7c4b8e574ba27a59d83267812493c029fd054c9242f3ac73100bc
```

This drastic change demonstrates the **avalanche effect** in hash functions, where even a **tiny modification** in the input produces a **completely different** hash output.

**h. Question:**

> **Do the hashes generated with `sha256sum` and `sha512sum` match the hashes generated in items (f) and (g), respectively? Explain.**

**Answer:**
Yes, the hashes generated using `sha256sum` and `sha512sum` **do match** those generated using `openssl sha256` and `openssl sha512`.

* SHA-256 hash (from item f and sha256sum):

```
43302c4500b7c4b8e574ba27a59d83267812493c029fd054c9242f3ac73100bc
```

* SHA-512 hash (from item g and sha512sum):

```
7c35db79a06aa30ae0f6de33f2322fd419560ee9af9cedeb6e251f2f1c4e99e0bbe5d2fc32ce501468891150e3be7e288e3e568450812980c9f8288e3103a1d3
```

**Explanation:** These tools (`openssl` and `shaXXXsum`) use the same underlying cryptographic algorithms. The difference is in how they format the output, not in the actual hash result.

### **Part 2: Verifying Hashes**

**b. Question:**

> **Was the sample.img downloaded without errors? Explain.**

**Answer:**
Yes, the file `sample.img` was downloaded without errors. The SHA-256 hash of the file:

```
c56c4724c26eb0157963c0d62b76422116be31804a39c82fd44ddf0ca5013e6a
```

**matches exactly** the hash provided in the `sample.img_SHA256.sig` file. This confirms that the file's contents are intact and have not been altered or corrupted during download.
