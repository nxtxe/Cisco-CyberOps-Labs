Sure, here are the answers in clear and simple English:

### **f. Question:**

**Is the new hash different than the hash calculated in item (d)? How different?**

**Answer:**
Yes, the new hash is completely different.

In item (d), the hash was:
`deff9c9bbece44866796ff6cf21f2612fbb77aa1b2515a900bafb29be118080b`

After changing one letter, the new hash is:
`43302c4500b7c4b8e574ba27a59d83267812493c029fd054c9242f3ac73100bc`

This shows the avalanche effect of hashing: even a tiny change in the file makes the entire hash change.

### **h. Question:**

**Do the hashes generated with `sha256sum` and `sha512sum` match the hashes generated in items (f) and (g), respectively? Explain.**

**Answer:**
Yes, they match exactly.

* SHA-256:
  `43302c4500b7c4b8e574ba27a59d83267812493c029fd054c9242f3ac73100bc`
* SHA-512:
  `7c35db79a06aa30ae0f6de33f2322fd419560ee9af9cedeb6e251f2f1c4e99e0bbe5d2fc32ce501468891150e3be7e288e3e568450812980c9f8288e3103a1d3`

Both are the same as the ones generated using `openssl`. This is because they all use the same algorithm; only the command-line tools differ.

### **b. Question:**

**Was the `sample.img` downloaded without errors? Explain.**

**Answer:**
Yes, it was downloaded without errors.

The hash from `sample.img_SHA256.sig` is:
`c56c4724c26eb0157963c0d62b76422116be31804a39c82fd44ddf0ca5013e6a`

The hash from the `sha256sum` command is:
`c56c4724c26eb0157963c0d62b76422116be31804a39c82fd44ddf0ca5013e6a`

Since both hashes are the same, the file was not changed or corrupted during download.
