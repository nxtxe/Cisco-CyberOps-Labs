**f. Question: Did the contents of the message.enc file display correctly? What does it look like? Explain.**
**Answer:**
No, the contents did not display as normal text.
It looked like random characters and symbols â€” unreadable.
This is because the file is encrypted binary data, not meant to be read directly.

**h. Question: Is message.enc displayed correctly now? Explain.**
**Answer:**
Yes, it displays correctly now.
The content is still encrypted but shown as readable characters using Base64 encoding.
It looks like a block of random-looking letters, numbers, and symbols.

**h. Question: Can you think of a benefit of having message.enc Base64-encoded?**
**Answer:**
Yes, Base64-encoded data can be safely shared as plain text, sent in emails, or stored in text files.
It makes binary data readable and compatible with systems that only support text.

### **Part 2: Decrypting Messages with OpenSSL**

**c. Question: Was the letter decrypted correctly?**
**Answer:**
Yes, the letter was decrypted correctly.
The content matches the original message in `letter_to_grandma.txt`.

---

**c. Question: The command used to decrypt also contains the `-a` option. Can you explain?**
**Answer:**
Yes, the `-a` option tells OpenSSL to decode the Base64-encoded input before decrypting.
This is necessary because we used Base64 when we encrypted the file.
