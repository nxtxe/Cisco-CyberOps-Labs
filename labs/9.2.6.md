### Part 2: Analyze the Packets using Wireshark

#### Examining the First Packet (SYN)

**Question:** What is the TCP source port number?  
**Answer:** For example, the source port is 58716.

**Question:** How would you classify the source port?  
**Answer:** It is an ephemeral (dynamic) port.

**Question:** What is the TCP destination port number?  
**Answer:** The destination port is 80 (HTTP).

**Question:** How would you classify the destination port?  
**Answer:** It is a well-known port.

**Question:** Which flag (or flags) is set?  
**Answer:** The SYN flag is set.

**Question:** What is the relative sequence number set to?  
**Answer:** It is set to 2432755549 (the initial sequence number).

#### Examining the Second Packet (SYN-ACK)

**Question:** What are the values of the source and destination ports?  
**Answer:**  
- **Source port:** 80 (HTTP)  
- **Destination port:** 58716

**Question:** Which flags are set?  
**Answer:** The SYN and ACK flags are set (SYN-ACK).

**Question:** What are the relative sequence and acknowledgment numbers set to?  
**Answer:**  
- **Relative sequence number:** 1766419191  
- **Acknowledgment number:** 2432755550

#### Examining the Third Packet (ACK)

**Question:** Which flag (or flags) is set?  
**Answer:** Only the ACK flag is set, which completes the handshake.

### Part 3: View the Packets using tcpdump

**Question:** What does the switch `-r` do?  
**Answer:** The `-r` switch tells tcpdump to read and display packets from a specified pcap file rather than capturing live traffic.

### Reflection Questions

**Question:** There are hundreds of filters available in Wireshark. List three filters that might be useful to a network administrator.  
**Answer:**  
- `tcp` (to view only TCP packets)  
- `ip.addr == 10.0.0.11` (to filter traffic for a specific IP address)  
- `icmp` (to view only ICMP traffic, e.g., for ping troubleshooting)

**Question:** What other ways could Wireshark be used in a production network?  
**Answer:** Wireshark can be used for troubleshooting connectivity issues, diagnosing network performance problems, detecting abnormal or malicious traffic, and verifying network security policies.
