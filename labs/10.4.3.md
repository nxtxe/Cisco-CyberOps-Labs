## Part 1: Analyze the FTP TCP Capture

### Step 1: TCP Three-Way Handshake

When you capture an FTP session, the first few packets are used to establish a TCP connection (the three‑way handshake). The example below is based on a typical capture.

#### 1. Initial SYN Packet (from the VM to the FTP server)

| **Field**               | **Example Value**                | **Explanation**                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP address**   | 192.168.0.11                     | The IP of your VM (FTP client)                                  |
| **Destination IP address** | 192.168.0.14                 | The IP of the FTP server (anonymous FTP server)                 |
| **Source port number**  | 58716                            | An ephemeral port dynamically chosen by the client              |
| **Destination port number** | 21                         | FTP uses port 21 (well‑known port)                                |
| **Sequence number**     | 2432755549                       | Initial sequence number chosen by the client                      |
| **Acknowledgment number** | 0 (not set)                   | Not present in a SYN packet                                      |
| **Header length**       | 20 bytes                         | Typical TCP header length when no options are set                |
| **Window size**         | 29200                            | Advertised window size for flow control                          |

#### 2. SYN‑ACK Packet (from the FTP server to the client)

| **Field**               | **Example Value**                | **Explanation**                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP address**   | 192.168.0.14                     | FTP server’s IP address                                          |
| **Destination IP address** | 192.168.0.11                 | Client’s IP address                                              |
| **Source port number**  | 21                               | FTP server port                                                  |
| **Destination port number** | 58716                     | Matches the client’s ephemeral port                              |
| **Sequence number**     | 1766419191                       | Initial sequence number chosen by the server                     |
| **Acknowledgment number** | 2432755550                    | Acknowledges client’s SYN (client’s sequence number + 1)           |
| **Header length**       | 20 bytes                         | Typical header length                                            |
| **Window size**         | 28960                            | Advertised window size by the server                             |

#### 3. ACK Packet (completing the handshake)

| **Field**               | **Example Value**                | **Explanation**                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP address**   | 192.168.0.11                     | Client’s IP address                                              |
| **Destination IP address** | 192.168.0.14                 | FTP server’s IP address                                          |
| **Source port number**  | 58716                            | Client’s ephemeral port                                          |
| **Destination port number** | 21                         | FTP server port                                                  |
| **Sequence number**     | 2432755550                       | Next sequence number after SYN sent                              |
| **Acknowledgment number** | 1766419192                    | Acknowledges server’s SYN (server’s sequence number + 1)           |
| **Header length**       | 20 bytes                         | Standard TCP header length                                       |
| **Window size**         | 29200                            | Typically remains the same as initially advertised               |

**Question:** How many other TCP datagrams contained a SYN bit?  
**Answer:** In the three‑way handshake, only the first (SYN) and second (SYN‑ACK) packets have the SYN bit set. The third packet (ACK) does not have the SYN flag.

### Step 2: FTP Data Transfer and TCP Session Termination

During the FTP session, after the handshake the client issues FTP commands (like `ls`, `get Readme`, etc.). After the file transfer completes, the TCP session is terminated gracefully. (Although no specific header details are requested for these packets, note that the FIN and ACK flags are used during termination.)

For example
- A FIN packet from the server (FIN flag set) followed by an ACK from the client.
- Then, a FIN from the client and a final ACK from the server to complete the shutdown.

## Part 2: Analyze the TFTP UDP Capture

In Part 2, you capture a TFTP session (which uses UDP) between two Mininet hosts.

### Step 1: TFTP Request (First UDP Datagram)

| **Field**                   | **Example Value**                | **Explanation**                                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP address**       | 10.0.0.11                        | IP of the TFTP client (host H1)                                      |
| **Destination IP address**  | 10.0.0.12                        | IP of the TFTP server (host H2)                                      |
| **Source port number**      | 58029                            | A random ephemeral port chosen by the client                         |
| **Destination port number** | 69                               | TFTP uses port 69 (well‑known port)                                  |
| **UDP message length**      | 40 bytes (for example)           | Total length of UDP header (8 bytes) + TFTP data (32 bytes, may vary)  |
| **UDP checksum**            | 0x1a2b (example)                 | Checksum to verify UDP header and data integrity                     |

**Question:** How does UDP verify datagram integrity?  
**Answer:** UDP uses a 16‑bit checksum computed over the UDP header and payload; the receiver recalculates this checksum to verify data integrity.

### Step 2: TFTP Response (First UDP Datagram from Server)

| **Field**                   | **Example Value**                | **Explanation**                                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source IP address**       | 10.0.0.12                        | IP of the TFTP server                                               |
| **Destination IP address**  | 10.0.0.11                        | IP of the TFTP client                                               |
| **Source port number**      | 69                               | TFTP server’s well‑known port                                        |
| **Destination port number** | 58029                            | Same ephemeral port as the client used                              |
| **UDP message length**      | (e.g., 48 bytes)                 | Length may vary depending on response content                        |
| **UDP checksum**            | 0x3c4d (example; may appear incorrect due to offload) | Checksum may be computed in hardware (offload) and appear “incorrect” in capture |


## Reflection Question

**Question:** This lab provided the opportunity to analyze TCP and UDP protocol operations from captured FTP and TFTP sessions. How does TCP manage communication differently than UDP?  
**Answer:**  
- **TCP:**  
  - Connection‑oriented; requires a three‑way handshake to establish a connection.  
  - Provides reliable delivery through sequencing, acknowledgments, and retransmission of lost packets.  
  - Uses flow and congestion control, ensuring ordered data delivery.
- **UDP:**  
  - Connectionless; sends datagrams without establishing a connection.  
  - Provides no reliability, ordering, or flow control—reducing overhead but increasing the chance of data loss.  
  - Suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability (e.g., TFTP, streaming).
