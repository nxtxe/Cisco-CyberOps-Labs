### **Part 1: Analyze Pre-Captured Logs and Traffic Captures**

**Questions:**

> **What are all those symbols shown in the Follow TCP Stream window? Are they connection noise? Data? Explain.**
> **Answer:**
> Those symbols represent raw binary data being transmitted as part of the executable file. They are not noise, but actual compiled program instructions and data that are not meant to be human-readable.

> **There are a few readable words spread among the symbols. Why are they there?**
> **Answer:**
> The readable words are strings embedded in the binary. These can include metadata such as paths, error messages, copyright info, or debugging text used by the application.

> **Challenge Question: Despite the W32.Nimda.Amm.exe name, this executable is not the famous worm. For security reasons, this is another executable file that was renamed as W32.Nimda.Amm.exe. Using the word fragments displayed by Wireshark’s Follow TCP Stream window, can you tell what executable this really is?**
> **Answer:**
> By reviewing readable text fragments in the stream, one might see indicators like `putty` or `PuTTY Release`, suggesting that the file is actually a copy of the PuTTY executable—a popular SSH client for Windows—renamed for lab purposes.

### **Part 2: Extract Downloaded Files from PCAP**

> **Why is W32.Nimda.Amm.exe the only file in the capture?**
> **Answer:**
> Because this capture only includes the HTTP GET request and the corresponding response for a single file download. No other files were requested or transferred during this session.

> **Was the file saved?**
> **Answer:**
> Yes. The `ls -l` command output confirms that `W32.Nimda.Amm.exe` exists in the `/home/analyst` directory and has a size of 345088 bytes.

> **In the malware analysis process, what would be a probable next step for a security analyst?**
> **Answer:**
> The next step would be to safely analyze the file in a controlled sandbox environment. The analyst might also calculate and compare the file’s hash (e.g., MD5 or SHA256) against threat intelligence databases, perform static or dynamic analysis, and monitor its behavior when executed.
