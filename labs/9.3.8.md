### Part 1: Exploring Nmap

**Question:** What is Nmap?  
**Answer:** Nmap is a network exploration and security auditing tool that maps networks and discovers hosts and services.

**Question:** What is nmap used for?  
**Answer:** It is used to discover devices on a network, identify open ports and running services, and perform operating system detection.

**Question:** What is the nmap command used in Example 1?  
**Answer:** The command shown is `nmap -A -T4 <target>`, which enables advanced scanning features and sets aggressive timing.

**Question:** What does the switch `-A` do?  
**Answer:** The `-A` option enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

**Question:** What does the switch `-T4` do?  
**Answer:** The `-T4` option sets the timing template to "Aggressive," speeding up the scan process.

### Part 2: Scanning for Open Ports

#### Step 1: Scan your localhost

**Question:** Which ports and services are opened?  
**Answer:** For example, port 21 is open for FTP and port 80 is open for HTTP.

**Question:** For each of the open ports, record the software that is providing the services.  
**Answer:**  
- **Port 21:** Provided by vsftpd (version 2.0.8 or later)  
- **Port 80:** Provided by Apache HTTP Server (e.g., Apache httpd 2.4.7 on Ubuntu)

#### Step 2: Scan your network

**Question:** Which network does your VM belong to?  
**Answer:** Based on the IP 10.0.2.15 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0, the VM belongs to the 10.0.2.0/24 network.

**Question:** How many hosts are up?  
**Answer:** (Example answer) The Nmap scan shows that 3 hosts are up on the network.

**Question:** From your Nmap results, list the IP addresses of the hosts that are on the same LAN as your VM. List some of the services that are available on the detected hosts.  
**Answer:** For example, the scan detected hosts at 10.0.2.15 (the VM), 10.0.2.2, and 10.0.2.10. Available services include SSH, HTTP, and FTP on some of these hosts.

### Part 3: Review a Remote Server Nmap Scan Example

**Question:** What is the purpose of scanme.nmap.org?  
**Answer:** The site is provided by the Nmap project to let users legally practice port scanning and network discovery.

**Question:** Which ports and services are opened?  
**Answer:** Open ports include port 22 (SSH), port 80 (HTTP), and ports such as 9929 and 31337 (used by nping-echo).

**Question:** Which ports and services are filtered?  
**Answer:** Ports such as 25 (SMTP), 135 (MSRPC), 139, 445, and others are shown as filtered.

**Question:** What is the IP address of the server?  
**Answer:** The IP address is 45.33.32.156.

**Question:** What is the operating system?  
**Answer:** The scan indicates that the server is running Linux.

### Reflection Question

**Question:** Nmap is a powerful tool for network exploration and management. How can Nmap help with network security? How can Nmap be used by a threat actor as a nefarious tool?  
**Answer:** Nmap helps network administrators by identifying open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities, enabling them to secure and monitor their networks. Conversely, threat actors can use Nmap to gather detailed information about a network, discover exploitable services, and plan targeted attacks.
