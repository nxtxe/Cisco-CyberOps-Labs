### Part 1: Exploring Filesystems in Linux

**Question:** What is the meaning of the output from `ls -l /`? Where are the listed files physically stored?  
**Answer:** The output shows the files and directories in the root filesystem, which is mounted on `/dev/sda1`. They are physically stored on the partition `/dev/sda1`.

**Question:** Why is `/dev/sdb1` not shown in the output above?  
**Answer:** Because `/dev/sdb1` is not mounted as part of the root filesystem; it is a separate partition that isn’t mounted at `/`.

**Question:** After mounting `/dev/sdb1` on `~/second_drive`, why is the directory no longer empty? Where are the listed files physically stored?  
**Answer:** The directory now displays the contents of the `/dev/sdb1` filesystem (such as `lost+found` and `myFile.txt`), which are stored on the second hard drive partition.

### Part 2: File Permissions

**Question:** Consider the `cyops.mn` file. Who is the owner of the file? How about the group?  
**Answer:** The owner is `analyst` and the group is also `analyst`.

**Question:** The permissions for `cyops.mn` are `-rw-r--r--`. What does that mean?  
**Answer:** It means the owner can read and write the file, while the group and others can only read it.

**Question:** Why was the file not created with `touch /mnt/myNewFile.txt`? List the permissions, ownership, and content of the `/mnt` directory and explain what happened.  
**Answer:** The `/mnt` directory is owned by `root` with permissions `drwxr-xr-x`, so a regular user (analyst) doesn’t have write permission there. This is why the file wasn’t created.

**Question:** What can be done for the `touch` command above to be successful?  
**Answer:** Run the command with elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo touch /mnt/myNewFile.txt`) or change the directory’s permissions.

**Question:** What are the permissions of the `myFile.txt` file in the `second_drive` directory (before changing permissions)?  
**Answer:** The file initially has permissions `-rw-r--r--`, meaning the owner can read and write, and group/others can only read.

**Question:** After using `chmod 665 myFile.txt`, did the permissions change? What are the new permissions of `myFile.txt`?  
**Answer:** Yes. The new permissions are `-rw-rw-r-x`: owner and group can read/write, and others can read and execute.

**Question:** What command would change the permissions of `myFile.txt` to `rwxrwxrwx`, granting full access to everyone?  
**Answer:** The command is `chmod 777 myFile.txt`.

**Question:** After changing the file ownership to `analyst` and appending text with `echo test >> myFile.txt`, was the operation successful? Explain.  
**Answer:** Yes; once `analyst` became the owner, they had permission to modify the file, so appending “test” worked.

### Part 3: Symbolic Links and Other Special File Types

**Question:** Compare the permissions of the `malware` directory with the `mininet_services` file. What is the difference in the beginning part of their listing lines?  
**Answer:** The `malware` directory’s listing begins with a `d`, indicating it’s a directory, while `mininet_services` starts with a `-`, meaning it’s a regular file.

**Question:** What do you think would happen to `file2hard` if you opened a text editor and changed the text in `file2new.txt`?  
**Answer:** Since `file2hard` is a hard link to the same inode as `file2new.txt`, any changes made to `file2new.txt` will also appear in `file2hard`.
