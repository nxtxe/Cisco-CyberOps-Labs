### Part 1: Certificates Trusted by Your Browser

**What are certificate fingerprints? Why are they important?**
Fingerprints are hashes of certificates that uniquely identify them. They are important for verifying the authenticity of certificates.

**Who calculates fingerprints? How can they be found?**
Fingerprints are calculated by Certificate Authorities (CAs). They can be found using OpenSSL or via the browser.

### Part 2: Checking for MITM

**What hash algorithm does OpenSSL use?**
SHA-1.

**Why is this specific algorithm chosen? Does it matter?**
SHA-1 provides a short unique hash. It is now considered vulnerable, so SHA-256 is preferred.

**Do the fingerprints match?**
If they don't match, the connection may be intercepted.

**What does it mean?**
The fingerprints don't match, which suggests a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
