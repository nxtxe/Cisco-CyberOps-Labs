### Part 1: Tracing a Route Using Traceroute

**Question:** Review the geographical locations of the responding hops. What did you observe regarding the path?  
**Answer:** The traceroute output shows that packets pass through multiple routers located in different regions, often taking a non-linear path across various ISPs and countries before reaching the destination.

### Reflection Question

**Question:** How is the traceroute different when going to www.cisco.com (or other websites) from the terminal versus using the online website?  
**Answer:** When run from the terminal, traceroute reflects the path from your local network and may show fewer or different hops, while the online tool may provide additional geographical context and a visual map; results can vary based on your location and ISP routing.
