### Part 1: Normalize Timestamps in a Log File

**Question:** Were the Unix Epoch timestamps converted to Human Readable format? Were the other fields modified? Explain.
**Answer:** Yes, the Unix Epoch timestamps were converted to Human Readable format. The other fields were not modified because the AWK script only changed the third column.

**Question:** Compare the contents of the file and the printed output. Why is there the line, `||Wed 31 Dec 1969 07:00:00 PM EST`?
**Answer:** That line appears because of an extra empty line at the end of the file. AWK treats it as a row with missing values, and the missing timestamp defaults to 0, which converts to that date and time.

**Question:** Is the output correct now? Explain.
**Answer:** Yes, after removing the extra empty line, the output no longer shows the incorrect timestamp row and only displays the actual log entries with correct human-readable timestamps.

**Question:** What was printed by the command above? Is this expected?
**Answer:** The command printed nothing to the screen because the output was redirected to a file named `applicationX_in_human.log`. This is expected behavior when using `>` to save output to a file.

### Part 2: Normalize Timestamps in an Apache Log File

**Question:** In the context of timestamp conversion, what character would work as a good delimiter character for the Apache log file above?
**Answer:** A space (" ") would work as a good delimiter because each field in the Apache log file is separated by spaces.

**Question:** How many columns does the Apache log file above contain?
**Answer:** It contains seven columns.

**Question:** In the Apache log file above, what column contains the Unix Epoch Timestamp?
**Answer:** The fourth column contains the Unix Epoch Timestamp.

**Question:** Was the script able to properly convert the timestamps? Describe the output.
**Answer:** No, the script didnâ€™t convert the timestamps correctly because the square brackets around the timestamp prevented the conversion from working properly.

**Question:** Can you guess what caused the incorrect output? Is the script incorrect? What are the relevant differences between the applicationX\_in\_epoch.log and apache\_in\_epoch.log?
**Answer:** The issue is caused by the square brackets around the timestamp in the Apache log file. The script is not incorrect but needs to remove those brackets first. Unlike applicationX\_in\_epoch.log, the Apache log wraps the timestamp in square brackets.
