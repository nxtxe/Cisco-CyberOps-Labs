### Part 1: Servers

**Question (a):** Why was it necessary to run ps as root (prefacing the command with sudo)?  
**Answer:** Running ps with sudo is required to see all processes, including those owned by other users or the system.

**Question (b):** How is the process hierarchy represented by ps?  
**Answer:** It is shown as a tree structure where child processes are indented under their parent processes.

**Question (c):** What is the meaning of the –t, –u, –n, –a and –p options in netstat? Is the order of the options important to netstat?  
**Answer:**  
- **-t:** Displays TCP connections  
- **-u:** Displays UDP connections  
- **-n:** Shows numerical addresses and port numbers  
- **-a:** Displays all connections and listening ports  
- **-p:** Shows the process ID and program name  
The order of the options is not important.

**Question (d):** Based on the netstat output, what is the Layer 4 protocol, connection status, and PID of the process running on port 80? While port numbers are just a convention, can you guess what kind of service is running on port 80 TCP?  
**Answer:**  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Status:** LISTEN  
- **PID:** 395 (example value)  
Port 80 TCP typically indicates a web server (HTTP service).

**Question (e):** The process PID 395 is nginx. How could that be concluded from the output above?  
**Answer:** The output shows the command name “nginx” associated with PID 395.

**Question (e) continued:** What is nginx? What is its function?  
**Answer:** Nginx is a lightweight web server that also functions as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

**Question (e) continued:** The second line shows that process 396 is owned by a user named http and has process 395 as its parent process. What does that mean? Is this common behavior?  
**Answer:** It means that process 396 is a worker process spawned by the master nginx process (PID 395). This is common in multi-process server designs.

**Question (e) continued:** Why is the last line showing grep 395?  
**Answer:** Because the grep command itself appears in the ps output when filtering for “395.”

### Part 2: Using Telnet to Test TCP Services

**Question (a):** Why was the error sent as a webpage?  
**Answer:** Because nginx is a web server and it formats error messages as HTML pages.

**Question (b):** Use Telnet to connect to port 68. What happens? Explain.  
**Answer:** Telnet to port 68 typically fails or times out because port 68 is used by DHCP clients and no service is listening for Telnet connections on that port.

### Reflection Questions

**Question (1):** What are the advantages of using netstat?  
**Answer:** Netstat displays active network connections, listening ports, and associated process IDs, helping to diagnose network and service issues.

**Question (2):** What are the advantages of using Telnet? Is it safe?  
**Answer:** Telnet is useful for quickly testing TCP services and connectivity; however, it is not secure because it transmits data in plain text and lacks encryption.
